# hadoop-regression

This repo is an example of Hadoop Map-Combiner-Reduce operation over CSV files.

Regression is a Java program that gathers tree data from arbres2.csv file, representing a tree sample.

The goal of this is to calculate a covariance between the age and the height of the tree.

The covariance of this example is about 54, so the two variables are linked.
